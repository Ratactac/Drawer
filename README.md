<h3>Drawer</h3>

  
<p>DrawerApp is a navigation drawer that appears at the top of the macOS screen, allowing you to quickly access your files without taking your eyes off the current application.
It makes adding files to your work software easier with minimal, single, or dual-panel modes—particularly useful for workflows that require frequent access to resources. 
It also provides quick access to a dedicated notes panel, independent from the one built into macOS.</p>

### Add Notes
- I was only able to test it on my Intel x86 Sonoma. But the build is also Apple Silicon, so I don't know if it will work. 
- The interface is designed and based on the dark appearance. There may be some defaults in light mode.
- Next update will add drag & drop between double view. 

## How to build

Clone the project via this Terminal command: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Drawer/Drawer.git

- You're all set! Now open the `MonitorControl.xcodeproj` with Xcode!
