<h3>Drawer</h3>
<p>DrawerApp is a navigation drawer that appears at the top of the macOS screen, allowing you to quickly access your files without taking your eyes off the current application.
It makes adding files to your work software easier with minimal, single, or dual-panel modes—particularly useful for workflows that require frequent access to resources. 
It also provides quick access to a dedicated notes panel, independent from the one built into macOS.</p>
